Discord bot for sending and storing daily reports

### Rules: 
- You need to call command `/prompt` and send your first report, after that, you will be subscribed to the notifications every working day at 12:00 (server time)
- Bot has some hardcoded values: discord acc of the author, bots settings, and author teammates names (do not change them)
- To get the best view of the report you should write all your tasks in separate text areas in a modal window, every task should be split by pressing the 'Enter' button

* Have fun
